# Single node, Memory Only Emulator for Google Bigtable

This is a single-node, non-persistent emulator for Google's Bigtable.

It should pass all the integration tests in Google's C++ client
repository (google-cloud-cpp), except those that must run against
production Bigtable.

## Development

It's a good idea to set home (`$HOME/.bazelrc` on Unixes) or system `bazelrc`
and enable compilation cache there with this line:
```
build --disk_cache=~/.cache/bazel/disk-cache
```
Note that the cache directory grows indefinitely.

## Building

Building the Bigtable emulator requires `bazel`.

```shell
bazel build //...
```

## Running the Unit Tests

```shell
bazel test //...
```

## Running clang-tidy with Bazel

```shell
bazel build --config clang-tidy //...
```

## Running the Emulator

```shell
bigtable-emulator -p <port>
```

## Development

### Formatting the code
```bash
# On bash you neet to enable globstar with `shopt -s globstar` first
clang-format -i -style=file -assume-filename=.clang-format **/*.cc **/*.h
```
